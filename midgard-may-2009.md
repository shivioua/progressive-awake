### Description

Step into the vibe of May 2009 with this DJ mix inspired by an unforgettable trip to Krakow with friends. From the historic streets of Kazimierz to a bonfire by Zakrzówek's waters, and a great night at Midgard club, where After Sky set the tone — these moments shaped the energy of this mix. 

This is the 10th installment of the Progressive Awake series, it takes you on a journey through progressive house and tech house, blending deep, pulsating beats with the echoes of those vibrant experiences.
